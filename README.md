## So, here goes nothing. 
	Been the past few days on my spare time and between compiles at work reading up on writing 
	a chess engine in c++11. Found this amazing	community online with a ton of information 
	about chess engines. Which made me really excited and wanted to start working on one of my
	own.

## The important task of giving the project a Name.
	Yesterday I actually setup the Project on GitHub etc. Started out with calling it Gambit.
	We'll see if the name sticks. Did a quick check	online if any other engine was called
	Gambit without finding anything so.

## Insomnia
	Last night I had real issues falling a sleep, my head was spinning with ideas and of all
	the information I've been reading. I decided to go with test driven development of my 
	chess engine. I think it would be good approach for developing a chess engine and also
	to learn more indepth writing TDD.

	Started writing tests for setting up the board.
